# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
# Description
This project tracks and marks a bus route, starting at MIT and ending at Harvard. Upon pressing the button marked "show stops between MIT and Harvard", the marker will travel the route showing each stop along the way.
# How it works
First download the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository. Then drag and drop the index.html file onto a blank page and watch as the icon travels along the bus route.
# Roadmap
In the future I would like to change the tracking icon to a bus icon.
